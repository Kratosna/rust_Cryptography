KEM-TLS shows clear efficiency advantages over traditional post-quantum (PQ) TLS approaches across almost every metric that matters in practice. Its handshake messages are much smaller—about 2.4 KB compared to roughly 7.1 KB in PQ-TLS—, which translates to a bandwidth reduction of around 66%. The main reason is that KEM-TLS avoids large PQ signatures such as ML-DSA (Dilithium), which alone add more than 2 KB to each handshake, and instead relies on lightweight KEM ciphertexts for authentication.

This design choice also pays off in computation time. A KEM-TLS handshake completes in about 234 microseconds, compared to roughly 400 microseconds for PQ-TLS, making it around 40% faster. Memory usage follows the same trend, with KEM-TLS requiring about 14 KB per connection instead of 20 KB. These savings make a real difference in constrained environments like IoT devices, mobile applications, or embedded systems where both memory and energy are limited.

That said, these gains come with important trade-offs. KEM-TLS requires an extra half round-trip during the handshake (1.5-RTT instead of 1-RTT), which can add around 25 ms of latency under typical network conditions. For latency-sensitive applications, this added delay may outweigh the cryptographic speed-ups. Even more importantly, KEM-TLS is still a research prototype: it does not yet integrate with existing public key infrastructures and lacks standardization. In contrast, hybrid PQ-TLS aligns with current PKI models and is moving toward standardization and browser support in the 2024–2025 timeframe.

As a result, PQ-TLS remains the practical choice for today’s production systems, especially for web and enterprise deployments that depend on PKI compatibility. KEM-TLS, however, is highly promising for future or specialized use cases where efficiency is critical—such as high-frequency trading, battery-sensitive mobile applications, or large-scale IoT deployments. Your implementation highlights why KEM-TLS is such an active research topic: it delivers quantum-resistant security while being faster, smaller, and conceptually simpler than signature-based alternatives.
